## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 Final-year CS & Computer Engineering student at UCT
- 🛠️ Strong foundations in **Networking, Operating Systems, C++, Machine Learning, and Embedded Systems**
- ⚙️ Learning to master both **low-level performance** and **high-level design**
- 🤖 Currently building a **machine learning-based anomaly detection system** for network traffic (NetMonX)
- 💡 I believe in learning by **building, breaking, and rebuilding**. The best code is not just correct—it’s elegant.
- ☕ Powered by late-night coffee, fire playlists, and **never giving up**.
